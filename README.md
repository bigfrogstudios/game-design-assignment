# BigFrog Studios - Technical Assignment for Game Design

## We're waiting for you!
I hope you are ready to join our awesome young company!

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to give you a similar experience of what is going to be your daily work at BigFrog Studios.

## Task
1. Based in a given Unity Scene, customize the scene removing the prototype prefabs and using the assets that we provided as an Unity package. Otherwise, if you just parachuted into this page, feel free to use whatever 3D assets you like.
2. You will find 2 NPCs, NPC_1 and NPC_1. You will also find a PLAYER. You must replace their content as well to match your scene aesthetic.
3. Create a Storyline for your scene with your NPCs and Player as characters and save as a normal text (.txt) file inside your project.

## Tips and Rules
- In this project you will find a Unity scene named *EDIT_THIS_SCENE* where you should do your task.
- Animations is not a requirement.
- You must delivery the task as a fork or a branch of this Git repository.
