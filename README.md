## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to give you a similar experience of what is going to be your daily work at BigFrog Studios.

## Task
Based in a given Unity Scene, customize the scene removing the prototype prefabs and using the assets that we provided as an Unity package. Otherwise, if you just parachuted into this page, feel free to use whatever 3D assets you like.

## Tips and Rules

- Animations is not a requirement.
- You must delivery the task as a fork or a branch of this Git repository.
