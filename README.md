# BigFrog Studios - Technical Assignment for Game Design

## We're waiting for you!
I hope you are ready to join our awesome young company!

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to give you a similar experience of what is going to be your daily work at BigFrog Studios.

## Task
1. Change the *EDIT_THIS_SCENE* using the Unity package that was provided to you. ONLY USE ASSETS FROM THE PROVIDED PACKAGE.
2. You will find 2 NPCs, NPC_1 and NPC_2. You will also find a PLAYER. You MUST replace their content with the asset package that we provided.
3. Create a Storyline for your scene with your NPCs and Player as characters and save as a normal text (.txt) file inside your project.

## Tips and Rules
- In this project you will find a Unity scene named *EDIT_THIS_SCENE* where you should do your task.
- Feel free to add, change, or remove lights from the scene.
- Animations is not a requirement.
- You must delivery the task as a fork Git repository.

## Example
Obs: The following example is not considered a well made test, is just an idea of what we expect in terms of size. Be creative.
